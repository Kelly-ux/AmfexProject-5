            What is a Computer?
            A computer is a programmable electronic device designed to perform tasks automatically and with speed and accuracy that far surpasses human capabilities. It can process data, store information, and communicate with other computers through networks.
            A Brief History of Computing
            The concept of a machine that could perform calculations automatically dates back centuries. However, the modern computer as we know it emerged in the mid-20th century. Early computers were massive, room-sized machines that used vacuum tubes for processing. They were primarily used for scientific and military purposes.
            Over time, computers have become smaller, faster, and more affordable, leading to their widespread adoption in various industries and households. The development of microprocessors in the 1970s revolutionized computing, making it possible to create personal computers (PCs) that were accessible to individuals.
